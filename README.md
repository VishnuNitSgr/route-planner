## 🔹 Features

- **List All Stations:** View all metro stations in the network.  
- **Show Metro Map:** Visual representation of the Delhi Metro network.  
- **Shortest Distance:** Calculate the shortest path between two stations in terms of distance.  
- **Shortest Time:** Calculate the quickest route considering travel time.  
- **Interactive Input:** Enter source and destination stations to get results dynamically.  
- **Real-time Output:** Displays results instantly on the page.

## 🔹 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure of the web page  
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** – Logic for Dijkstra’s Algorithm and dynamic interaction  

---

## 🔹 How It Works

- Uses **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** to compute the shortest path in the metro network graph.  
- Stores metro stations and connections in a JavaScript data structure.  
- Dynamically updates the output section with calculated distance or time.
